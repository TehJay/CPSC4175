### 1. ###
 The four components of a software crisis are: 

	a. Economic
	b. Maintenance  
	c. Requiement, Analysis, and Design
	d. Team Development


### 2. ###
To state the difference between SLC & SDLC, we need to first define them. SLC is a description of the steps that should be performed during the development project, and it ranges from creation to the retirement of a particular software. SDLC is a process of developing and maintaining a software. The main difference between the two is that SLC defined as a one way path, whereas SDLC is process which is continuously looping.

Perfective Maintenance: changes expected by the clients; Snapchat users wanted to have the ability to creates groups, so in their 2016 update snapchat brought on that feature.  

Adaptive Maintenance: changes required in order to deal with changes in the environment. With the introduction of Android 4.0 and its popularity, many big-name apps had to make their software compatible with the newer version of android.

Hardware, the physical component of a computer system, is more susceptible to damage and ware. As time passes, new hardware inventions usually tend to be more usable than the older versions. On the other hand, software has more flexibility to survive any systemic changes. Software can be upgraded to run on a new OS, hardware, etc. This validates the claim that as time passes, current versions of hardware will wear off, whereas software can be continuously upgraded and made more usable.

This statement states that cost of correcting bugs in the project is smaller as long as the project hasn't been published to the client, however the dev team will not know of as many errors if they haven't implemented the project with the client/users. This is the reason why the topic of testing your code is stress across the tech industry. 

### 6. ###


There are no distinct planning, testing, or documentation phases because these three are integral part of the entire SDLC process from start to finish. All three need to happen at every stage of the process in order to avoid any confusion and errors. If there is no planning, testing, or documenting, then the entire team can run into issues during the software development life cycle.

The OOP paradigm takes the arichitecture of its stages from the Classical Paradigm. The OOP uses the same steps as Structured programming throughout, the only thing which has changed is the terminology and the inherent use. In struture programming, the design and coding begins in the design phase, whereas with OOP the objects enter cycle from the beginning.

### 8. ###

Regular meeting with Clients or reading User reports is necessary because it allows for the dev team to gather more information about the needs of the software and the overall user experience. User experience is utmost important because it is often the source of power for a project.

### 9. 

I am subcribed to reddit.com/r/programming   
This is a community of developer where there are daily posts of new technology, current state of affairs with computing, and etc. This helps me to stay up to date with most talking points in the tech community. 

### 10. ###

This book describes two aspects software development - the Cathedral, in which a few programmers release cycles of their software to the world, a mode employed by the business world. Then there's the Bazaar, in which rapid development around a core team of developers is favored, developers who are constantly in contact with users and co-developers, which entails most of open source software development. It explains very clearly why the OS movement is so popular; it also gives you an idea of why so many OS advocates are insufferable zealots. Eric Raymond's tone is of a preacher preaching his message of revolutionary open-source, and while he makes good points, he also ignores some of the economic and security realities.
