### 1. ###
The very first step in a creating a software should be finding your the requirements aka what the client/Users *want*. Based on the initial picture, the developers have a starting point in a SDLC.  
### 2. ###
More often than not Client is the one missing critical idea of software requirement. This is due to Client's inability to keep up with the latest technology or having minimal information on how their organization works. As an example stated in book, a client needs a software with quick response, but the client is unaware of terrible database design which is causing the problem. At times, something that the clients needs is rarely put into the overall design and vice-versa. In order to effectively begin the development process, the team will need to strike a balance between what the client needs and what it should do.   
### 3. ###
A software engineer has to be a generalist in the sense of product design. For a product to work with an array of users and inputs, a SE has adapt his design in order to match and execute everyone's request. Without product flexibility, the product is susceptible to errors and failure. 
### 4. ###
1. Interviewing: To some Interviews are considered too structured. As mentioned in books, there would be no use of an interview if the requirement team already knows of the needs, on the other hand the interviewer must be familiar with the application domain in order to ask the right questions. An unstructured interview conducted by an interviewer who listens
carefully and poses questions that amplify initial responses usually yields far
better information than a thoughtfully worded questionnaire. 
2. Sending Questionnaire: This might cause a lot of time waste if the company has more than a hadnful employees as the dev team will have to go through many responses. 
3. Direct Observation: The main issue here is Time and unwarranted invasion of Privacy.Time is an issue since the analyser will have to sit back and playback through hours of footage. 
### 5. ###
Requirements are constantly changing. A business's will have to adapt to different technology and models in order to stay with the competition. And because of this, the software used by the business is constantly changing along with the business. 
### 6. ###
Definition of ‘a functional requirement’ is that it essentially specifies something the system should do.
Typically, functional requirements will specify a behavior or function, for example:
“Display the name, total size, available space and Other examples are “add customer” and “print invoice”. Definition for a non-functional requirement is that it essentially specifies how the system should behave and that it is a constraint upon the systems behaviour. One could also think of non-functional requirements as quality attributes for of a system.
### 7. ###
A method of analysis that involves looking at the "big picture" first, and then analyzing the details of smaller components. By first analyzing the overall picture, such as software requirement, a SE can start to look at the development process. 
### 8. ###
Even though prototyping has handful advantages, according to many SE, the disadvantages outnumber them. Insufficient analysis leads to confusion between original requirements and prototype report. User are confused since the final product and the prototype are inherently different. Time and money, if either of these items are of the essence than prototyping can put a serious hole on the overall project time line. 
### 9. ###
Even thought Team 1 is having to make less changes, I believe that Team 2 is actually doing the better job because I can tell that the Team wants to get the SRS to a perfect state; However, this may also signal that they're unsure and unaware of their client/users needs. 
### 10. ###
In the SDLC, requirement analysis is the base of the process. If the base falls, the standing structure breaks. If a project is completed with improper SRS, then project will become useless to the client or even have significant usability issues.
