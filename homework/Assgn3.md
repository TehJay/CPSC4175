# Assignment 3 - Jay Patel #

### 1. ###
SRS must contain as to what the software must do and also include any constraint.
It includes many thing like:  
1. Deadline for delivering product  
2. portability constraints (OS, System specification)   
3. Reliability  
4. Rapid response time  
5. acceptance criteria for both dev team and client to decide on. 
### 2. ###
For example, developer was working with a client and asked that they needed to be able to upload "large files." SE found a solution with a partner who assured the team that their platform could handle the "large files." We had a solution and we began testing. Client were giving us feedback that the solution was not meeting their needs, was freezing and full of bugs. To the client "large" meant 20-50GB and to our team and the platform provider "large" meant up to 5GB.Â   
   
This is just a simple account of ambiguity in a SRS. The definition of a 'large file' between the developer and the client shows the vast difference which could make or break the project
### 3. ###
The grading system holds together Student, Student info, and instructor profile. The initial interaction begins with the student and it moves to the insturctor for grading and finally it will be depicted in the SIS. 
### 4. ###
The cart is initially empty and the user will have to add/remove items, then the whole system move to a summary screen for conformation where the user can finalize or cancel the order. Then it is moved to the checkout side for payment and etc. 
### 5. ###
Customer creates one or more order. Order can have multiple products. Product can be on multiple orders. 
### 6. ###
For our project, input will be from the user in moving the game pieces, control will be set by the gamepieces properties, as a game of chess has many controls and restrictions. Our output will depend on if the user has won or the next turn for the second player.  
### 7. ###
This is a basic game loop design which work with our chess game. The game is initialized, the it checks for winning condition which is only accepted if the players play, after the winning condition is met then the game will cleanup itself.
### 8. ###
An Object-Z class (Credit Card) is introduced via a class schema. A visibility list specifies those features that may be accessed by user. Methods specify local functions, constants, and State attributes. Then, an initial state is specified  (0 balance here). Finally, operation schemas defining methods of a class appear. The syntax for predicates and expressions is derived from standard Z, which are particularly suited for object-oriented specification.
