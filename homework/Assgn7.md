## Homework 7 - Jay Patel ##

### 1. ###
Testing is an integral component
of the software process and an activity that must be carried out throughout the
life cycle: During the requirements workflow, the requirements must be checked; The design workflow requires meticulous checking at every stage. During the implementation workflow, each code artifact certainly
must be tested; and the product as a whole needs testing when it has been fully integrated. If testing is ignored after every phase, and it is only completed only before product production, then the entire project can fail if any minor component stops working. 

### 2. ###
Verification refers to the process of determining whether a workflow has been correctly carried out;
taking place at the end of each workflow. Validation is the intensive
evaluation process that takes place just before the product is delivered to the client. Its
purpose is to determine whether the product as a whole satisfies the specifications. Both of these terms relate to the idea of testing at the end, whether its at the end of a workflow or at the end of project. The book suggests that term verification should be left alone as it advises to test only after the workflow has been completed, whereas, we should be testing in parallel to the workflow process. 

### 3. ###
Non-execution based testing says to Review specification, design, and physically look through source code for any flaws without executing any code. On the other hand, in execution based testing, the dev will have to run the program against test data and examine for any errors. 

### 4. ###
The quality of software is the extent to which the product satisfies its specifications, however, the concept of 'quality' software also ensures that a product is coded meticulously and well designed in order for proper maintenance. More precisely, SQA group also has to develop standards to which future releases must conform to, additionally, establish monitoring procedures for ensuring compliance with those standards. SQA group not only ensure quality of SWE process, but also ensure the quality and maintenance of the final product. 

### 5. ###
This idea is prevalent in all of life on earth. For example, a scientist making a drug for a diseases can't test his own product. On the other hand, a patient with a disease won't be able to make his/her drug for the cure. This idea can be applied to many fields across globe, therefore, it is applicable in SWE.

### 6.  
A correctness proof is a mathematical technique for showing that a product is correct,
in other words, that it satisfies its specifications. If the project composed of running a sorting alg, then correctness proof is very like going through the code on a piece of paper and validating it. On the other hand, execution testing is to actually run the code against sample input which tests it. Execution testing is a better overall technique. First, it is claimed that software engineers lack adequate mathematical training. Second, it is suggested that proving is too expensive to be practical; and third, proving is too hard for most dev teams.

The kinds of "Photoshop-like" programming tools referenced in this piece are certainly coming and will certainly change the world, largely for the better but also magnify our problems. At the beginning of this piece, the author wrote about how code failures caused the stock market to crash on the same day and we needed a fix. But the fix suggested is the opposite of a real fix. The fix suggested is to make us even more reliant on computer code. There are real risks involved in moving our society so heavily to computer-controlled automation. The problem is that hyper-specialization makes us much richer and more economically efficient while at the same time making us much more fragile because we are poorly adapted to respond when our systems break down.

I'm quite optimistic about the chances of not having an apocalypse as long as we as a society are planning for the future 24/7. For me, everything boils down to nature. No nature means no life, no life means no technology. Personally, my role in addressing concerns is to maintain maximum sustainability of nature using technology in order to remain on toes when that apocalypse comes. I'm saying this since I don't believe we will have that software apocalypse as long as nature prevents it.
